    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Loaf Cake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°f / 180°c. Grease and line a 1 lb (8"x4") loaf pan with a piece of parchment paper that extends over the sides. </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, eggs, olive oil, and vanilla until well combined. </li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger. Add to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. </li>
        <li>Add the grated carrot and switch to a rubber spatula, and mix until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to the prepared loaf pan. </li>
        <li>Bake for 60 minutes or until the top springs back when pressed lightly and a skewer or tester inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs attached. </li>
        <li>Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes then remove onto a wire rack and allow to cool completely. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Maple Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl using a spatula or electric mixer, combine together the cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt until smooth and incorporated. </li>
        <li>Add the maple syrup and mix to combine. </li>
        <li>Spread the frosting over the surface of the cooled carrot loaf cake. Slice into pieces using a serrated or sharp knife. </li>
